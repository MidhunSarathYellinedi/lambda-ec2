# lambda-ec2
Lambda function identifies stale EBS snapshots that are not associated with an active EC2 instance and deletes them to save on storage costs.

**Problem Statement:** Developers in an organization forgot to delete EBS volume snapshots after working on EC2 instances. When snapshots go unnoticed for a while, they lead to unnecessary cloud costs, which can be simply avoided by notifications or by automating the removal of such stale resources.

**To solve this**, I opted to delete them by leveraging AWS Lambda function that runs a custom Python script that:

- Retrieves all EBS snapshots in the user account.
- Filters out stale snapshots that havenâ€™t been accessed in a while.
- Deletes those identified stale snapshots.

To follow the principle of least privilege, I was picky with the custom IAM policies and to fully automate the flow, a cron job was set up using AWS CloudWatch and EventBridge to trigger the Lambda function at selected intervals that ensure timely cleanup.
